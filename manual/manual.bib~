  abstract = {Abstract Aim A panbiogeographical analysis of the genus Bomarea was
	undertaken in order to determine generalized tracks and biogeographical
	nodes, and to evaluate the current distribution of the genus based
	on the available tectonic information and the biogeographical regionalization
	of Latin America. Location The Neotropical region from northern Mexico
	to northern Argentina, and the Nearctic and Andean regions. Method
	A total of 2205 records of 101 species were analysed, representing
	95% of the species assigned to Bomarea. Localities were represented
	on maps and their individual tracks were drawn. Based on their comparison,
	generalized tracks were detected and mapped. Nodes were identified
	in the areas where different generalized tracks were superimposed.
	Results Five generalized tracks were recovered. One is located in
	the Eastern Central America and Western Panamanian Isthmus provinces
	(Caribbean subregion, Neotropical region), which was supported by
	three species of Central American distribution. The four remaining
	generalized tracks were located in South America, in the North Andean
	Paramo, Cauca and Puna biogeographical provinces. These tracks were
	supported by species of Bomarea with an Andean distribution. Biogeographical
	nodes were established in the Central Andean region of Colombia,
	central Ecuador and central Peru. Main conclusions The nodes obtained
	for Bomarea support a hybrid origin for the Andean region, which
	presents diverse components from both northern and southern South
	America. Likewise, the track recovered between Colombia and Ecuador
	includes Andean and Neotropical areas, providing further support
	for this hypothesis. The nodes obtained are coherent with vicariant
	elements evident for Bomarea. Species of three clades proposed for
	Bomarea are distributed in specific generalized tracks.},

  abstract = { Parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) was used to analyse the distributional
	patterns of 124 species of Mexican gymnosperms, using two different
	sample units: grid-cells and biogeographical provinces. PAE analyses
	were based on distributional data from herbarium specimens and specialized
	literature. Two data matrices were constructed for 60 grid-cells
	of 2o and 14 biogeographical provinces. The analysis of the 2o grid-cell
	matrix led to 7084 cladograms. The strict consensus cladogram showed
	several clades equivalent to the results obtained with the biogeographical
	provinces. Three clades agree with some principal regions of distribution
	of Mexican pines, previously identified by several authors, located
	at the northern portion of the Baja California peninsula, the Sierra
	Madre Occidental, and the Sierra Madre Oriental. These areas represent
	important centres of species diversity and endemism for Mexican gymnosperms.
	The analysis of the province matrix led to two most parsimonious
	cladograms, which only differed in the position of the Sierra Madre
	Occidental province. The iterative procedure PAE with progressive
	character elimination was applied to identify generalized tracks,
	where clades of provinces were considered equivalent to generalized
	tracks, and each time a cladogram was obtained, species defining
	its clades were deleted and a new run was undertaken. We found five
	generalized tracks, mainly located in montane provinces. The distribution
	patterns of gymnosperms agree with the existence of several Mexican
	biogeographical provinces, and a different historical biogeography
	of the Mexican peninsulas from the rest of the country is evident.

	stage. Quantitative biogeography, both at the historical and ecological
	levels, will play an increasingly important role because rapidly
	increasing amounts of data will require quantitative methods and
	computer analysis. An effective way to comprehend quantitative methods
	and to determine when they can be effective is to consider any biogeographic
	study as a multistage decision process. Not only does this provide
	a framework for such activities, but it also emphasizes that one's
	conclusions are affected by decisions made at different stages of
	the study. The best perspective is that biogeography is an unending
	synthesis, both of many types of theories and of many types of data
	and analyses to test them. A corollary to this approach is that no
	single method or analysis can answer all questions of biogeographic
	interest. Finally, while computers and quantitative analyses can
	enhance the human mind, they can never replace it.},

  abstract = { Aim The geographical distributions of animal and plant species endemic
	to the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands were analysed to locate
	and designate areas of endemicity. Location The Iberian Peninsula
	and the three largest Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Menorca and Ibiza)
	in the western Mediterranean, West Palaearctic region. Methods The
	information analysed consisted of presence/absence data of animal
	and plant species, recorded on a 100 x 100 km grid based on the UTM
	projection system. From a larger initial data set, a simplified matrix
	of 480 species present in at least two quadrats was obtained, and
	processed to estimate the overall similarity patterns across land
	squares, and the areas of endemism. Two methods were employed to
	detect areas of endemism: Wagner Parsimony (PAE, or parsimony analysis
	of endemicity) and compatibility. A modification of PAE, PAE-PCE
	(Parsimony analysis of endemicity with progressive character elimination)
	was applied to overcome some of the potential shortcomings of the
	method. Results The results represent the first attempt for a combined
	analysis of animal and plant distributions in the western Mediterranean.
	The proposed PAE-PCE procedure proved useful to identify areas of
	endemism that would have been otherwise overlooked. Up to thirty-six
	different areas of endemisms were identified. Some of these represent
	concentric (hierarchically nested) structures, while other are partly
	overlapping sectors. The endemism areas, as derived from parsimony
	and compatibility analyses, generally fit within the frame of the
	overall similarity approach. Main conclusions The areas of endemicity
	identified often coincide with mountain sectors, and this may be
	of incidental interest for conservation policies as most natural
	preserves in the study area are located in mountain ranges. The conclusions
	are of interest for large scale approaches to the biogeography of
	the Mediterranean Basin, facilitating the selection of endemism areas
	for operative purposes. However, most of the best supported areas
	of endemism detected are relatively small, or overlap with neighbouring
	endemism areas. Hence, adopting large area units such as `Iberia'
	for historical analysis at a wider geographical scale may be risky,
	because such units may actually represent composite sectors of an
	heterogeneous nature. The distribution of the areas of endemism,
	as well as the results of the overall similarity classification,
	share a number of features with previous sectorizations from independent,
	mostly phytogeographical, approaches. Parsimony analysis of endemicity
	is a potentially useful tool for identifying areas designated by
	species with congruent distributions, but (1) the results have no
	direct historical implications (for phylogenetic information is not
	incorporated), and (2) unless modifications such as the PAE-PCE procedure
	are applied, the number of potential areas of endemism (in the sense
	stated above) will often be underestimated. It is also shown that,
	in a PAE, a `total evidence' approach is to be preferred to a consensus
	of partial (taxon-specific) results. },

	Three generalized tracks were obtained: (1) Mexican North Pacific,
	(2) Mexican Central Pacific, and (3) Southern Mexico-Guatemala. A

	with the Neovolcanic Axis in central Mexico. Main conclusions Freshwater
	generalized tracks with an altitudinal distribution below 1000 m,
	mainly including fishes and angiosperms, are close to the Tropical
	Mesoamerican generalized track. Generalized tracks above 1000 m,
	including freshwater crabs, have a stronger affinity with the Mountain

  abstract = {{Microphyllae (subgenus Acanthadesmia) is the series of the genus
	Adesmia with the largest number of described species, and its distribution
	includes most of the genus range. The biogeographic evolutionary
	history of this series, as well as the genus, is unclear. Some hypotheses
	suggest that the development of the Andes affected the evolution
	of the genus Adesmia, but there is no evidence about the processes
	(e.g., dispersal or vicariance) involved. In this study we used a
	panbiogeographic approach, and based on the distribution of 22 species
	of this series we carried out a track analysis and a parsimony analysis
	of endemicity (PAE). Distribution area of the series was divided
	in quadrats of 1 degrees x 1 degrees (Latitude x Longitude), and
	latitudinal and longitudinal belts of 1 degrees. All the species
	presented a distribution associated with the Andes, and most of them
	presented both latitudinally and longitudinally restricted distributions.
	Five generalized tracks and two nodes were found. All tracks were
	longitudinally associated with the Andean range. Nodes could be associated
	with the South American Transition Zone. PAE based on latitudinal
	belts split the total area in two sub-areas (north and south), where
	the limit between them is central Chile (ca. 33 degrees S). This
	division is characterized by the presence of A. miraflorensis in
	the northern zone, and A. volckmannii in the southern zone. Our results
	suggest a recent differentiation within the series Microphyllae,
	which may have resulted from isolation of populations along the Andes,
	i.e., vicariance events fragmented the distribution of species and
	subsequently caused differentiation. It seems likely that this separation
	has occurred latitudinally, as suggested by the latitudinal sequence
	of generalized tracks.}},

  abstract = {{Historical biogeography is going through an extraordinary revolution
	concerning its foundations, basic concepts, methods, and relationships
	to other disciplines of comparative biology. There are external and
	internal forces that are shaping the present of historical biogeography.
	The external forces are: global tectonics as the dominant paradigm
	in geosciences, cladistics as the basic language of comparative biology
	and the biologist's perception of biogeography. The internal forces
	are: the proliferation of competing articulations, recourse to philosophy
	and the debate over fundamentals. The importance of the geographical
	dimension of life's diversity to any understanding of the history
	of life on earth is emphasized. Three different kinds of processes
	that modify the geographical spatial arrangement of the organisms
	are identified: extinction, dispersal and vicariance. Reconstructing
	past biogeographic events can be done from three different perspectives:
	(1) the distribution of individual groups (taxon biogeography) (2)
	areas of endemism (area biogeography), and (3) biotas (spatial homology).
	There are at least nine basic historical biogeographic approaches:
	centre of origin and dispersal, panbiogeography, phylogenetic biogeography,
	cladistic biogeography, phylogeography, parsimony analysis of endemicity,
	event-based methods, ancestral areas, and experimental biogeography.
	These nine approaches contain at least 30 techniques (23 of them
	have been proposed in the last 14 years). The whole practice and
	philosophy of biogeography depend upon the development of a coherent
	and comprehensive conceptual framework for handling the distribution
	of organisms and events in space.}},

  abstract = {{Aim Halffter's Mexican Transition Zone is a complex area in which
	the Neotropical and Nearctic regions overlap. We test its existence
	and extension through a track analysis of beetle taxa, and discuss
	the implications of geographical homology. Location The area analysed
	corresponds to the Caribbean subregion, which occupies Mexico, Central
	America, north-western South America, and the Western Indies. Methods
	The panbiogeographic or track analysis was based in the comparison
	of 134 individual tracks belonging to different beetle taxa (species
	and supraspecific groups). A Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity (PAE)
	was applied in order to classify the areas by their shared taxa according
	to the most parsimonious cladogram, and the nested sets of areas
	were represented as generalized tracks. Results Two generalized tracks
	resulted: (1) northern generalized track: comprising the Sierra Madre
	Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Transmexican Volcanic Belt, Balsas
	Basin and Sierra Madre del Sur biogeographic provinces; and (2) southern
	generalized track: comprising the Chiapas, Mexican Gulf, Mexican
	Pacific Coast and western Panamanian Isthmus biogeographic provinces.
	Main conclusions The generalized tracks obtained correspond broadly
	to Halffter's Nearctic and Mesoamerican patterns, respectively; however,
	in contrast to Halffter's Mesoamerican pattern, the southern generalized
	track extends further north through the lowlands of the Pacific and
	Mexican Gulf coasts.}},
