	In TI mode you can start the program with no parameters or with 
	input/output/values files
	
	If no input file is given, PT will ask for the name of the input file
	and creates an output labeled as my-input.kml and the default values for 
	comparisons will be used.  

	If input and output files are provided, the default values for 
	comparisons will be used.  
	
	If input, output and values files are provided, PT will use these
	files and will turn to the text interface to start the analysis.
	
	All commands are given as a single letter.
