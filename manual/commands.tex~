	general
	
	\tui{l} == list			List all tracks
	
	
	comparing *tracks*
		
	\tui{a} == all			Track all the species using MSTs to compare			
	
	\tui{g} == group		Track a group of contiguous species
	
	\tui{p} == pair			Track a pair of species (contiguous or not)
	  
	In all the three cases a new MST=track will be created if the
	species compared are congruent, while in a [p]air comparison
	only a single track could be created. In an [a]ll/[g]roup 
	comparison, there could be more than one track.


	comparing *segments*
		
	\tui{s} == all			Track all the species using segments to compare			
		
	\tui{t} == pair			Track a pair of species (contiguous or not)
	  



	join

	
	\tui{u} == join group	Join a group of contiguous tracks if a given pair 

							has a minimal congruence equal or higher than the

							minimal congruence inputed in the value file or

							the default value used in the TUI. If you want to join

							a group regardless of the minimal congruence value,

							reduce the min. cong. value to 0.0. After this late

							analysis, replace the original min. cong. value
						

	\tui{j} == join pair		Join two, contiguous or not, tracks independent of

						the minimal congruence value
						

	congruence calculation
	
	\tui{o} == congr. group	Calculate the congruence by pairs of a contiguous group,

						as ther output is a list, is easier to reade a small 

						group than a large group
							

	\tui{n} == congr. pair	Calculate the congruence of a single pair 
	

	modify decision rules
	
	\tui{c} == cut			Change the minimal cut value

	\tui{r} == rules			Modify rules 

	\tui{m} == min. cong.		Change the minimal congruence value (see join)
	


\section{Bash command mode}
\label{bash_commands}
\index{commands:bash}

A bash command is an instruction that will perform an analysis equal to the analysis made in the text user interface [ see page \pageref{tui_commands}]. This mode is more appropriated to medium to huge data sets, where the analysis could last more than a few minutes or to test different parameter values. 

The commands are given in the equivalence of the TUI, with a short explanation.


		\cmd{kmlgen} == 	write to the kml file ONLY the generalized tracks (default). Must be in the file before the analysis. 

		\cmd{kmlall} == 	write to the kml file all, individual and generalized tracks. Must be in the file before the analysis.


		\cmd{croizat0} ==\\ 	join (individual tracks),\\ 
							track  (individual tracks),\\ 
							join (generalized tracks) \\
							%
= \tui{u} (1 - \# individual tracks), %
\tui{a},
\tui{u} ( individual tracks + 1) total tracks

		\cmd{croizat1} == \\	track  (individual tracks)\\ 
							join (generalized tracks)\\ 
= \tui{a}, \tui{u} (individual tracks +1) total tracks



A sample command file is 


\cmd{set cv 1.5}\\
\cmd{set lmax 2.0}\\
\cmd{set lmin 0.6}\\
\cmd{set maxline 3.0}\\
\cmd{set ci 0.80}\\
\cmd{kmlall}\\
\cmd{croizat0}\\

So, these seven lines in a file will change the default parameters to 
\cmd{cv = 1.5},
\cmd{lmax = 2.0},
\cmd{lmin = 0.6},
\cmd{maxline = 3.0},
\cmd{ci = 0.80},
and will use these values to join the indidual tracks if the congruence value of the two MSTs compared is larger than  0.80, then \mt  \_will track those resulting MST to obtain the generalized tracks and will eliminate (joint) those redundant tracks using the same rule used before (\cmd{ci = 0.80}), and will output the individual and the generalized tracks.
