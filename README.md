This project uses well documented geometrical functions to evaluate congruence between tracks (=MST) and therefore perform a Panbiogeographical analysis. Although the origin is Panbiogeography, the program could be used to evaluate common patterns as Areas of Endemism or Design of Conservation reserves or Primary Homology (in a biogeographical context). The paper describing the algorithm could be found at PlosONE [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0018460].
